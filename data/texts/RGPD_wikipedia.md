General Data Protection Regulation
The
General Data Protection Regulation
(Regulation (EU) 2016/679),
[
1
]
abbreviated
GDPR
, is a
European Union regulation
on
information privacy
in the
European Union
(EU)and the
European Economic Area
(EEA). TheGDPR is an important component of EU
privacylaw
and
human rights law
, in particular Article8(1) of the
Charter of Fundamental Rights of theEuropean Union
. It also governs the transfer of
personal data
outside the EU and EEA. TheGDPR's goals are to enhance individuals' controland rights over their personal information and tosimplify the regulations for
internationalbusiness
.
[
2
]
It supersedes the
Data ProtectionDirective
95/46/EC and, among other things,simplifies the terminology.
The
European Parliament
and
Council of theEuropean Union
adopted the GDPR on 14 April2016, to become effective on 25 May 2018. As an
EU regulation
(instead of a
directive
), the GDPRhas direct legal effect and does not require
transposition
into national law. However, it alsoprovides flexibility for individual member statesto modify (derogate from) some of its provisions.
As an example of the
Brussels effect
, theregulation became a model for many other lawsaround the world, including in Brazil, Japan,Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka,and Thailand.

After
leaving the EuropeanUnion
the United Kingdom enacted its "UKGDPR", identical to the GDPR.
[

The
CaliforniaConsumer Privacy Act
(CCPA), adopted on 28June 2018, has many similarities with theGDPR.
[

The GDPR 2016 has eleven chapters, concerning general provisions, principles, rights of the datasubject, duties of data controllers or processors, transfers of personal data to third countries,supervisory authorities, cooperation among member states, remedies, liability or penalties for

breach of rights, provisions related to specific processing situations, and miscellaneous finalprovisions. Recital 4 proclaims that ‘processing of personal data should be designed to servemankind’.
The regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects information about livingpeople, whether they are in the EU or not), or processor (an organisation that processes data onbehalf of a data controller like cloud service providers), or the data subject (person) is based in theEU. Under certain circumstances,
[
6
]
the regulation also applies to organisations based outside theEU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation doesnot apply to the processing of data by a person for a "purely personal or household activity andthus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity." (Recital 18).
According to the
European Commission
, "Personal data is information that relates to an identifiedor identifiable individual. If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, thenyou need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account theinformation you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by eitheryou or any other person to identify that individual."
[
7
]
The precise definitions of terms such as"personal data", "processing", "data subject", "controller", and "processor" are stated in
Article4
.
[
1
]
: Art. 4
The regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national securityactivities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing apotential conflict of laws have questioned whether
Article 48
could be invoked to seek to preventa data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from thatcountry's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authoritiesthe personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU.
Article 48
states that any judgement of a court or
tribunal
and any decision of an administrativeauthority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal datamay not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement,like a
mutual legal assistance treaty
in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country andthe EU or a member state. The data protection reform package also includes a separate DataProtection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector that provides rules on personal dataexchanges at
State level
, Union level, and international levels.
[
8
]
A single set of rules applies to all EU member states. Each member state establishes anindependent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanctionadministrative offences, etc.
[
1
]
: Arts. 46–55
SAs in each member state co-operate with other SAs,providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations. If a business has multipleestablishments in the EU, it must have a single SA as its "lead authority", based on the location ofits "main establishment" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority thusacts as a "
one-stop shop
" to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout theEU.
[
9
]
[
10
]
A
European Data Protection Board
(EDPB) co-ordinates the SAs. EDPB thus replaces the
Article 29
Data Protection Working Party. There are exceptions for data processed in anemployment context or in national security that still might be subject to individual countryregulations.

General provisions
14/08/2025 11:13 General Data Protection Regulation - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation 3/33
Article 5
sets out six
principles
relating to the lawfulness of processing personal data. The first ofthese specifies that data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. Article 6develops this principle by specifying that personal data may not be processed unless there is atleast one legal basis for doing so. The other principles refer to "purpose limitation", "
dataminimisation
", "accuracy", "storage limitation", and "integrity and confidentiality".
Article 6
states that the lawful purposes are:
(a) If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data;
(b) To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject, or for tasks at the request of a datasubject who is in the process of entering into a contract;
(c) To comply with a data controller's legal obligations;
(d) To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual;
(e) To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority;
(f) For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party, unless these interests areoverridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights according to the
Charter ofFundamental Rights
(especially in the case of children).
If informed
consent
[
1
]
: Art. 4(11)
is used as the lawful basis for processing, consent must have beenexplicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for.
[
1
]
: Art. 7
Consent must be a specific,freely given, plainly worded, and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject; an onlineform which has consent options structured as an opt-out selected by default is a violation of theGDPR, as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user. In addition, multiple types ofprocessing may not be "bundled" together into a single affirmation prompt, as this is not specific toeach use of data, and the individual permissions are not freely given. (Recital 32).
Data subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time, and the process of doing somust not be harder than it was to opt in.
[
1
]
: Art. 7(3)
A data controller may not refuse service to userswho decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service.
[
1
]
: Art. 8
Consent for children, defined in the regulation as being less than 16 years old (although with theoption for member states to individually make it as low as 13 years old), must be given by thechild's parent or custodian, and verifiable.
[
11
]
[
12
]
If consent to processing was already provided under the Data Protection Directive, a datacontroller does not have to re-obtain consent if the processing is documented and obtained incompliance with the GDPR's requirements (Recital 171).
[
13
]
[
14
]
Article 12
requires the data controller to provide information to the "data subject in a concise,transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular forany information addressed specifically to a child."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation 4/33
The
right of access
(
Article 15
) is a data subject right.
[
15
]
It gives people the right to access theirpersonal data and information about how this personal data is being processed. A data controllermust provide, upon request, an overview of the categories of data that are beingprocessed
[
1
]
: Art. 15(1)(b)
as well as a copy of the actual data;
[
1
]
: Art. 15(3)
furthermore, the datacontroller has to inform the data subject on details about the processing, such as the purposes ofthe processing,
[
1
]
: Art. 15(1)(a)
with whom the data is shared,
[
1
]
: Art. 15(1)(c)
and how it acquired thedata.
[
1
]
: Art. 15(1)(g)
A data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to andinto another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. Data that has beensufficiently anonymised is excluded, but data that has been only de-identified but remains possibleto link to the individual in question, such as by providing the relevant identifier, is not.
[
16
]
Inpractice, however, providing such identifiers can be challenging, such as in the case of Apple's
Siri
,where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier that the manufacturer restrictsaccess to,
[
17
]
or in online behavioural targeting, which relies heavily on
device fingerprints
that canbe challenging to capture, send, and verify.
[
18
]
Both data being 'provided' by the data subject and data being 'observed', such as about behaviour,are included. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured andcommonly used standard electronic format. The right to
data portability
is provided by
Article20
.
A
right to be forgotten
was replaced by a more limited
right of erasure
in the version of the GDPRthat was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014.
[
19
]
[
20
]
Article 17
provides that thedata subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of anumber of grounds, including noncompliance with
Article 6(1)
(lawfulness) that includes a case(f) if the legitimate interests of the controller are overridden by the interests or fundamental rightsand freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data (see also
Google SpainSL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González
).
[
21
]
Article 21
of the GDPR allows an individual to object to processing personal information formarketing or non-service related purposes.
[
22
]
This means the data controller must allow anindividual the right to stop or prevent controller from processing their personal data.
There are some instances where this objection does not apply. For example, if:
1.
Legal or official authority is being carried out
2.
"Legitimate interest", where the organisation needs to process data in order to provide the datasubject with a service they signed up for
3.
A task being carried out for public interest.
GDPR is also clear that the data controller must inform individuals of their right to object from thefirst communication the controller has with them. This should be clear and separate from anyother information the controller is providing and give them their options for how best to object tothe processing of their data.
Information and access
14/08/2025 11:13 General Data Protection Regulation - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation 5/33
There are instances the controller can refuse a request, in the circumstances that the objectionrequest is "manifestly unfounded" or "excessive", so each case of objection must be looked atindividually.
[
22
]
Other countries such as Canada
[
23
]
are also, following the GDPR, consideringlegislation to regulate automated decision making under privacy laws, even though there are policyquestions as to whether this is the best way to regulate AI.
Article 82
of the GDPR stipulates that any person who has suffered material or non-materialdamage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receivecompensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.
In the judgment
Österreichische Post
(C-300/21) the Court of Justice of the European Union gavean interpretation of the right to compensation.
[
24
]
Article 82(1) GDPR requires for the award ofdamages
(i)
an infringement of the GDPR,
(ii)
(actual) damage suffered and
(iii)
a causal linkbetween the infringement and the damage suffered. It is not necessary that the damage sufferedreaches a certain degree of seriousness. There is no European defined concept of damage.Compensation is determined nationally in accordance with national law. The principles ofequivalence and effectiveness must be taken into account.
[

Krankenversicherung Nordrhein
(C-667/21).
[

]
Data controllers must clearly disclose any
data collection
, declare the lawful basis and purpose fordata processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any thirdparties or outside of the EEA. Firms have the obligation to protect data of employees andconsumers to the degree where only the necessary data is extracted with minimum interferencewith data privacy from employees, consumers, or third parties. Firms should have internal controlsand regulations for various departments such as audit, internal controls, and operations. Datasubjects have the right to request a
portable
copy of the data collected by a controller in a commonformat, as well as the right to have their
data erased
under certain circumstances. Publicauthorities, and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing ofpersonal data, are required to employ a
data protection officer
(DPO), who is responsible formanaging compliance with the GDPR. Data controllers must report
data breaches
to nationalsupervisory authorities within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In somecases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwideturnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.
To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implementmeasures that meet the principles of data protection by design and by default.
Article 25
requiresdata protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for productsand services. Such measures include
pseudonymising
personal data, by the controller, as soon aspossible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implementeffective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if theprocessing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74). When data iscollected, data subjects must be clearly
informed
about the extent of data collection, the legal basisfor the processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any
automated decision-making
that is made on a solely

basis. Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR,including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time, their right to
view theirpersonal data and access an overview of how it is being processed
, their right to obtain a
portablecopy of the stored data
, their right to
erasure of their data under certain circumstances
, their rightto contest any automated decision-making that was made on a solely
algorithmic
basis, and theirright to file complaints with a
Data Protection Authority
. As such, the data subject must also beprovided with contact details for the data controller and their designated data protection officer,where applicable.
[
27
]
[
28
]
Data protection impact assessments (
Article 35
) have to be conducted when specific risks occurto the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Risk assessment and mitigation is required and priorapproval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks.
Article 25
requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes forproducts and services. Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default, andtechnical and procedural measures shall be taken by the controller to make sure that theprocessing, throughout the whole processing lifecycle, complies with the regulation. Controllersshall also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessaryfor each specific purpose. This is known as data minimisation.
A report
[
29
]
by the
European Union Agency for Network and Information Security
elaborates onwhat needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default. It specifies thatencryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, becauseboth keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. Thereport specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe ifonly the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.
According to the GDPR,
pseudonymisation
is a required process for stored data that transformspersonal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subjectwithout the use of additional information (as an alternative to the other option of complete
dataanonymisation
).
[
30
]
An example is
encryption
, which renders the original data unintelligible in aprocess that cannot be reversed without access to the correct
decryption key
. The GDPR requiresfor the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from thepseudonymised data.
Another example of pseudonymisation is
tokenisation
, which is a non-mathematical approach toprotecting
data at rest
that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to astokens. While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value, they allow for specificdata to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kepthidden.
Tokenisation
does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed bylegacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. This also requiresmuch fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases thantraditionally encrypted data.
Pseudonymisation is a
privacy-enhancing technology
and is recommended to reduce the risks tothe concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their dataprotection obligations (Recital 28).

Pseudonymisation
14/08/2025 11:13 General Data Protection Regulation - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation 7/33
According to
Article 30
records of processing activities have to be maintained by eachorganisation matching one of following criteria:
employing more than 250 people;
the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of datasubjects;
the processing is not occasional;
processing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal datarelating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.
Such requirements may be modified by each EU country. The records shall be in electronic formand the controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor'srepresentative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request.
Records of controller shall contain all of the following information:
the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller,
[
a
]
thecontroller's representative and the data protection officer;
the purposes of the processing;
a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data;
the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed includingrecipients in third countries or international organisations;
where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation,including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case oftransfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitablesafeguards;
where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data;
where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measuresreferred to in Article 32(1).
Records of processor shall contain all of the following information:
the name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller on behalf ofwhich the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's or the processor'srepresentative, and the data protection officer;
the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;
where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation,including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case oftransfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the
documentation of suitable safeguards;
where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measuresreferred to in Article 32(1).
Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place
appropriate technical andorganizational measures
to implement the data protection principles.
[
32
]
Business processes thathandle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and providesafeguards to protect data (for example, using
pseudonymization
or full
anonymization
whereappropriate).
[
33
]
Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind. Forinstance, using the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publiclyavailable by default and cannot be used to identify a subject. No personal data may be processed

unless this processing is done under one of the six lawful bases specified by the regulation(
consent
, contract, public task, vital interest, legitimate interest or legal requirement). When theprocessing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time.
[
34
]
Article 33
states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authoritywithout undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms ofthe individuals. There is a maximum of 72 hours after becoming aware of the data breach to makethe report. Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact isdetermined.
[
1
]
: Art. 34
In addition, the data processor will have to notify the controller withoutundue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach.
[
1
]
: Art. 33
However, the notice to datasubjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical andorganisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person whois not authorised to access it, such as encryption.
[
1
]
: Art. 34
Article 37
requires appointment of a data protection officer. If processing is carried out by apublic authority (except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicialcapacity), or if processing operations involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects ona large scale, or if processing on a large scale of special categories of data and personal datarelating to criminal convictions and offences (
Articles 9
and
Article 10
) a data protection officer(DPO)—a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices—must be designatedto assist the controller or processor in monitoring their internal compliance with the Regulation.
A designated DPO can be a current member of staff of a controller or processor, or the role can beoutsourced to an external person or agency through a service contract. In any case, the processingbody must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO mayhold. The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation (forexample, in a privacy notice) and registered with the supervisory authority.
The DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing ITprocesses,
data security
(including dealing with
cyberattacks
) and other critical
business continuity
issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data. The skill setrequired stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws andregulations. The DPO must maintain a living data inventory of all data collected and stored onbehalf of the organization.
[
35
]
More details on the function and the role of data protection officerwere given on 13 December 2016 (revised 5 April 2017) in a guideline document.
[
36
]
Organisations based outside the EU must also appoint an EU-based person as a representative andpoint of contact for their GDPR obligations.
[

]
: Art. 27
This is a distinct role from a DPO, althoughthere is overlap in responsibilities that suggest that this role can also be held by the designatedDPO.

Article 42 and 43 of the GDPR set the legal basis for formal GDPR certifications. They set the basisfor two categories of certifications:

National certification schemes, whose application is limited to a single

/
EEA
country;
European Data Protection Seals, which are recognized by all EU and EEA jurisdictions.

GDPR Certification
14/08/2025 11:13 General Data Protection Regulation - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation 9/33
According to Art. 42 GDPR, the purpose of this certification is to demonstrate “compliance withthe GDPR of processing operations by controllers and processors”.
[
39
]
There are over 70 referencesto certification in the GDPR, encompassing various obligations such as:
[
39
]
Adequacy of the technical and organizational measures;
Data sharing with data processors;
Data protection by design and by default;
International data transfers.
The GDPR certification also contributes to reduce the legal and financial risks of applicants, as wellas of data controllers using certified data processing services.
[
40
]
The adoption of the European Data Protection Seals is under the responsibility of the
EuropeanData Protection Board
(EDPB) and is recognized across all EU and EEA
Member States
.
[
41
]
In October 2022, the Europrivacy certification criteria were officially recognized by the EuropeanData Protection Board (EDPB) to serve as European Data Protection Seal.

Europrivacy
wasdeveloped by the European research programme and is managed by the
European Centre forCertification and Privacy
(ECCP) in Luxembourg.
Besides the definitions as a criminal offence according to national law following
Article 83
GDPRthe following sanctions can be imposed:
a warning in writing in cases of first and non-intentional noncompliance
regular periodic data protection audits
a fine up to €10 million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financialyear in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater, if there has been an infringement of thefollowing provisions (

These are some cases which are not addressed in the GDPR specifically, thus are treated asexemptions.

Personal or household activities

]
: Art. 30
Conversely, an entity or more precisely an "enterprise" has to be engaged in "economic activity" tobe covered by the GDPR.
[
b
]
Economic activity is defined broadly under
European Unioncompetition law
.
[
44
]
The GDPR also applies to data controllers and processors outside of the
European Economic Area
(EEA) if they are engaged in the "offering of goods or services" (regardless of whether a payment isrequired) to data subjects within the EEA, or are monitoring the behaviour of data subjects withinthe EEA (Article 3(2)). The regulation applies regardless of where the processing takes place.
[
45
]
This has been interpreted as intentionally giving GDPR
extraterritorial jurisdiction
for non-EUestablishments if they are doing business with people located in the EU. It is questionable whetherthe EU or its member states will in practice be able to enforce GDPR against organisations whichhave no establishment in the EU.
[
46
]
Under
Article 27
, non-EU establishments subject to GDPR are obliged to have a designee withinthe European Union, an "EU Representative", to serve as a point of contact for their obligationsunder the regulation. The EU Representative is the Controller's or Processor's contact person vis-à-vis European privacy supervisors and data subjects, in all matters relating to processing, to ensurecompliance with this GDPR. A natural (individual) or legal (corporation) person can play the roleof an EU Representative.
[

: Art. 27(4)
The non-EU establishment must issue a duly signed document(letter of accreditation) designating a given individual or company as its EU Representative. Thesaid designation can only be given in writing.
[

]
: Art. 27(1)
An establishment's failure to designate an EU Representative is considered ignorance of theregulation and relevant obligations, which itself is a violation of the GDPR subject to fines of up to€10 million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case ofan enterprise, whichever is greater. The intentional or negligent (willful blindness) character of theinfringement (failure to designate an EU Representative) may rather constitute aggravatingfactors.
[

]
: Arts. 83(1) & 83(2) & 83(4a)
An establishment does not need to name an EU Representative if they only engage in occasionalprocessing that does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data asreferred to in Article 9(1) of GDPR or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictionsand offences referred to in Article 10, and such processing is unlikely to result in a risk to the rightsand freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes ofthe processing. Non-EU public authorities and bodies are equally exempted.

Explanation of the possible results fromUK's divergence from the EuropeanGDPR
[
50
]
Chapter V of the GDPR forbids the transfer of the personal data of EU data subjects to countriesoutside of the EEA — known as
third countries
— unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, orthe third country's data protection regulations are formally considered adequate by the EuropeanCommission (Article 45).
[
47
]
[
48
]
Binding corporate rules
, standard contractual clauses for dataprotection issued by a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), or a scheme of binding and enforceablecommitments by the data controller or processor situated in a third country, are amongexamples.

The applicability of GDPR in the United Kingdom isaffected by
Brexit
. Although the United Kingdom formallywithdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020, itremained subject to EU law, including GDPR, until the endof the transition period on 31 December 2020.
[
47
]
TheUnited Kingdom granted
royal assent
to the
DataProtection Act 2018
on 23 May 2018, which augmented theGDPR, including aspects of the regulation that are to bedetermined by national law, and criminal offences forknowingly or recklessly obtaining, redistributing, orretaining personal data without the consent of the datacontroller.
[
51
]
[
52
]
Under the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
, existing and relevant EU law was transposedinto UK law upon completion of the transition, and the GDPR was amended by
statutoryinstrument
to remove certain provisions no longer needed due to the UK's non-membership in theEU. Thereafter, the regulation will be referred to as "UK GDPR".
[
53
]
[
48
]
[
47
]
The UK will not restrictthe transfer of personal data to countries within the EEA under UK GDPR. However, the UK willbecome a
third country
under the EU GDPR, meaning that personal data may not be transferred tothe country unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, or the European Commission performs anadequacy decision on the suitability of British data protection legislation (Chapter V). As part ofthe
withdrawal agreement
, the European Commission committed to perform an adequacyassessment.

In April 2019, the UK

social media addiction
andon the use of this data for processing interests.

In March 2021,

14/08/2025 11:13 General Data Protection Regulation - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation 12/33
All processing of personal data requires consent of the data subject
In fact, data can be processed without consent if one of the other five lawful bases forprocessing applies, and obtaining consent may often be inappropriate.
[
57
]
Individuals have an absolute right to have their data deleted (right to be forgotten)
Whilst there is an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, data controllers can continueto process personal data where they have a lawful basis to do so, as long as the dataremain necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected.
[
58
]
Removing individuals' names from records takes them out of scope of GDPR
"Pseudonymous" data where an individual is identified by a number can still be personaldata if the data controller is capable of tying that data back to an individual in anotherway.
[
59
]
GDPR applies to anyone processing personal data of EU citizens anywhere in the world
In fact, it applies to non-EU established organizations only where they are processing dataof data subjects located in the EU (irrespective of their citizenship) and then only whensupplying goods or services to them, or monitoring their behaviour.
[
60
]
As per a study conducted by Deloitte in 2018, 92% of companies believe they are able to complywith GDPR in their business practices in the long run.
[
61
]
Companies operating outside of the EU have invested heavily to align their business practices withGDPR. The area of GDPR consent has a number of implications for businesses who record calls asa matter of practice. A typical disclaimer is not considered sufficient to gain assumed consent torecord calls. Additionally, when recording has commenced, should the caller withdraw theirconsent, then the agent receiving the call must be able to stop a previously started recording andensure the recording does not get stored.
[
62
]
IT professionals expect that compliance with the GDPR will require additional investment overall:over 80 percent of those surveyed expected GDPR-related spending to be at least US$100,000.
[
63
]
The concerns were echoed in a report commissioned by the law firm
Baker & McKenzie
that foundthat "around 70 percent of respondents believe that organizations will need to invest additionalbudget/effort to comply with the consent, data mapping and cross-border data transferrequirements under the GDPR."
[

The total cost for EU companies is estimated at €200 billionwhile for US companies the estimate is for $41.7 billion.

It has been argued that smallerbusinesses and
startup companies
might not have the financial resources to adequately complywith the GDPR, unlike the larger international technology firms (such as
Facebook
and
Google
)that the regulation is ostensibly meant to target first and foremost.
[
66
]
[
67
]
A lack of knowledge andunderstanding of the regulations has also been a concern in the lead-up to its adoption.
[
68
]
Acounter-argument to this has been that companies were made aware of these changes two yearsprior to them coming into effect and should have had enough time to prepare.
[
69
]
The regulations, including whether an enterprise must have a data protection officer, have beencriticized for potential administrative burden and unclear compliance requirements.
[
70
]
Althoughdata minimisation is a requirement, with
pseudonymisation
being one of the possible means, theregulation provides no guidance on how or what constitutes an effective data de-identificationscheme, with a grey area on what would be considered as inadequate pseudonymisation subject toSection 5 enforcement actions.

Despite having had at least two years to prepare and do so, many companies and websites changedtheir privacy policies and features worldwide directly prior to GDPR's implementation, andcustomarily provided email and other notifications discussing these changes. This was criticisedfor resulting in a fatiguing number of communications, while experts noted that some reminderemails incorrectly asserted that new consent for data processing had to be obtained for when theGDPR took effect (any previously obtained consent to processing is valid as long as it met theregulation's requirements).
Phishing

Until January 2023, the Commission published a new commitment based on thecomplaint of ICCL.

While companies are now subject to legal obligations, there are still various inconsistencies in thepractical and technical implementation of GDPR.
[
130
]
As an example, according to the GDPR'sright to access, the companies are obliged to provide data subjects with the data they gather aboutthem. However, in a study on loyalty cards in Germany, companies did not provide the datasubjects with the exact information of the purchased articles.
[
131
]
One might argue that suchcompanies do not collect the information of the purchased articles, which does not conform withtheir business models. Therefore, data subjects tend to see that as a GDPR violation. As a result,studies have suggested for a better control through authorities.
[
132
]
[
131
]
According to the GDPR, end-users'
consent
should be valid, freely given, specific, informed andactive.
[
133

However, the lack of enforceability regarding obtaining lawful consents has been achallenge. As an example, a 2020 study, showed that the
Big Tech
, i.e.
Google
,
Amazon
,
Facebook
,
Apple
, and
